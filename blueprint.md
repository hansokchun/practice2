# Project Blueprint

## Overview

A simple, interactive website that provides random answers to questions a user thinks about. The user clicks a button to receive a random answer.

## Design and Features

*   **Core Functionality:** Click a button to get a random answer. The answers include a mix of standard, weird, and random responses.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   A main container to center the content.
    *   A title to instruct the user.
    *   A button to trigger the answer.
    *   An area to display the random answer.
*   **Styling:**
    *   Centered layout.
    *   A simple, clean font.
    *   Basic styling for the button and answer display.
*   **Animation:**
    *   A "drop down" animation for the answer display.

## Current Task

    *   Update `main.js` with the new answers.
